7/24/23 NOTES

This project is taking longer than what I expected to take. I made
notes and attempted to plan out the entire logic behind the program
before coding but that fell apart when I tried mixing in the DOM
manipulation. Some key things that I need to re-study and firmly
grasp are 

-OOP ( specifically SOLID )
-ORGANIZATION OF CODE

I feel as I am creating an unnecessary amount of modules and
don't fully understand objects yet. I believe I can create
multiple functions in an object that all relate to the object
rather than creating an entirely new file for a function and
making it all co-dependent of eachother. Like in what the
Odin Project said, DO NOT make codes codependent on eachother,
yet, I failed to do that and will make sure to conciously NOT
do it again on my next project.

I might go back to this project later and redo it entirely or I might redo the entire project right now if I can't figure it out.
