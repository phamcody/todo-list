7/24/23 NOTES

This project is taking longer than what I expected to take. I made
notes and attempted to plan out the entire logic behind the program
before coding but that fell apart when I tried mixing in the DOM
manipulation. Some key things that I need to re-study and firmly
grasp are 

-OOP ( specifically SOLID )
-ORGANIZATION OF CODE

I feel as I am creating an unnecessary amount of modules and
don't fully understand objects yet. I believe I can create
multiple functions in an object that all relate to the object
rather than creating an entirely new file for a function and
making it all co-dependent of eachother. Like in what the
Odin Project said, DO NOT make codes codependent on eachother,
yet, I failed to do that and will make sure to conciously NOT
do it again on my next project.

I might go back to this project later and redo it entirely or I might redo the entire project right now if I can't figure it out.

8/2/23 NOTES

I'm starting to have a way better grasp and understanding of OOP and how they work with eachother. I've been slacking a little bit with the code however. I need to work on the SOLID principles, especially the Single Responsibility one as my code in the task() object rely on eachother in each method.

I'm most excited for finally having that "A-HA" moment with objects and arrays and how I am able to dynamically manipulate them. I'm aiming to finish this project today.
